In fact, we were left to carry our bags ourselves to the room allocated to us and to figure out just where the room was situated in the hotel in the first place. There was no hotel staff to led us. As we arrived late that evening and we were tired, we ordered for dinner (room service). The food was just fair. If I had a choice, I would have preferred to eat something else.

Everything was okay. However, for the transport to the  airport,  they need to improve. My flight was at 9h20. When I checked out  at 6h45 they told me that the next bus will be only at 8h00. I took a taxi and paid 50 cedis. Beside that service and staff were outstanding. I recommend this hotel.  \n",

I booked and fully paid for 2 nights for my little sister and her husband to spend their wedding night here. 10days prior, fully paid. The day before their arrival I sent mails to reservations to make their night special. I was assured this will be done. We arrived at 6pm today and it was just an ordinary room. Absolutely nothing had been done. The hotel staff were unhelpful. I ended up checking the couple into the room like that as they had had a long day and just needed to relax.\\nDefinitely not a hotel that pays attention to the important things that matter to us.  \n",

I call the place an excitement. Cant really pinpoint on what exactly makes them outstanding. Perhaps its their consistency over the 20 years ive known them. They are a blend of historic and contemporary lifestyle. They have a great collection of wines, good food. A secure parking lot etc  \n",

But I I can say it's a nice place to meet up. Lovely and relaxed ambience. Best of all, it's easily accessible with easy access to public transport. It's close to the airport and, Max mart (shopping center), and downtown Accra.  \n",

My husband and I spent a few days at the hotel last month and it was by far less than I had expected given how much I had heard about the hotel. When I made the booking, I requested for the room to be given a special touch (as it was valentines day and I did not mind paying extra for the service) but absolutely nothing was done. In fact, we were left to carry our bags ourselves to the room allocated to us and to figure out just where the room was situated in the hotel in the first place. There was no hotel staff to led us. As we arrived late that evening and we were tired, we ordered for dinner (room service). The food was just fair. If I had a choice, I would have preferred to eat something else. Overall, I think the hotel is not so bad, perhaps I had expected too much from them.  \n",

Not far from Kotoka International Airport and Ghana Institute of Management and Public Administration. It is located just by the road at Dzorwulu Junction intersection. Good accommodation for everyone including expats. Good security and a serene environment with more vegetation as well. Good meals and luxurious rooms. A superb car park. Very well organized hotel. I recommend it to everyone.  \n",

The area is very well taken care of. The drinks are reasonably priced. A bottle of Guinness cost 20 cedis. It is also close to the airport and about 15mins from Stanford Seed. The restaurants close at 3 and reopen at 6. Overall, I would  stay here again  \n",

       "69                                                           There are two hotels owned by the same person. Niagara inn the cheaper one and niagara hotel. This review is for niagara inn. It’s quite a more modern building than the hotel but with small stairs, wooden doors and tiny bathroom and toilet. Not very well kept too but for a visitor who booked online I was just grateful to lay my head somewhere safe. The area doesn’t look too good as well, a little bit dingy. Haven’t seen any hoodlums just yet. It’s a rest your head place definitely  not luxury and definitely not for a holiday. Very kind polite helpful front desk staff!! Wow , the extra star is for the nice fellow downstairs at the front desk. There is WiFi but the bathroom in the room I got is very small.\\nWater runs in trickles in the bathroom but if you can get over that and you do stay the night there’s breakfast that comes with the room. Everything always looks better in the morning!! The staff are quite nice I must say again.  \n",

The room is small with a small bathroom. There is no table in the room. It is cheap compared to the hotels around, hence fair considering the price. It also comes with breakfast- bread, egg & tea. There is free wifi with fair speed. May be worth considering if you have a constrained budget.  \n",

The receptionist promised it'll be fixed the next day but that never happened during my 4 day stay. The bathroom was too narrow for even one person let alone 2 to fit in there comfortably. I had to bath in a restricted position lest my body touched the walls, which weren't exactly the neatest. \\nI loved the layout of the room though, and the bed was very soft. None of the meals I took for breakfast stood out as exceptional to me.\\nThe receptionists were pleasant though,but overall I was unimpressed with this place  \n",

However, the bar is not in full operation and there is no restaurant. It is  a serene place to get away from the hustle and bustle of the city core. It's  located between Accra and Tema, on the Motorway also makes it a convenient get away for people who want to lodge at a location that is outside both cities but still have access to them.  \n",

Service was good however everything my friend ordered was unavailable. This could have been because of the time we arrived as it was quite late. The food we did receive was very nice and the atmosphere was lovely. I have very few complaints hence why I go back every year I’m in Ghana.  \n",
